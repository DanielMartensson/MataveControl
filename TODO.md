Here is a list of the following points that need to be fixed: 

* Fix better help comments at the top of all function

* Create a tutorial how to use the commands

* Remove all MPC commands - Create a new project of MPC

* Rename nlsim.m to satsim.m beacuse it's saturation function included nlsim.m

* Remove intss.m beacuse it's not integration.
