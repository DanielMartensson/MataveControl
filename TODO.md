Here is a list of the following points that need to be fixed: 

* Function reference need to be available. Write "help" and then the function name to view a input example. 

* Graphical template interfaces such as discontinuous functions for nonlinear simulation

* Fix so Bodeplots shows "Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3" etc.

* Fix legends so dbdrop shows the right color.

* Fix so Bode/Nyquist plot functions has default frequency intervall

* Fix better help comments at the top of all function

* Create a tutorial how to use the commands

* Create nlsim.m with saturation at states

* Edit this ">> lsim(sysd, U, T);
error: In signal vecor has not the same rows as B matrix" to ">> lsim(sysd, U, T);
error: In signal vecor has not the same columns as B matrix"
