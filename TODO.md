Here is a list of the following points that need to be fixed: 

* Function reference need to be available. Write "help" and then the function name to view a input example. 

* Graphical template interfaces such as discontinuous functions for nonlinear simulation

* Fix so Bodeplots shows "Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3" etc.

* Fix so lsim.m can return y,x values

* Fix legends so dbdrop shows the right color.
