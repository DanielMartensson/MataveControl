# matavecontrol
Matavecontrol is a basic toolbox for control engineering. The toolbox can be used for both GNU Octave and MATLAB®. Easy to use and easy to install. The main focus on matavecontrol is to offer a control toolbox which can be used in both GNU Octave and MATLAB®. Also the library is a very basic library so other developers can fast dive into the code.
