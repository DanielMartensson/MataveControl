# Updates

* Version 1.0 (2017-11-08)
 The realease of Matavecontrol
 
* Version 1.5 (2017-11-18)
Removed the solver fsolve and replaced it with ode45 because fsolve is a part of MATLABÂ® Optimization Toolbox, but freeware under GNU Octave. The new ode45 is going to solve the Algebraic Riccati Equations.

Fixed dbdrop.m so it takes G(0) as the beginning static gain.
